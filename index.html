    <!-- I want this to be like a huge list of all my available catsup stickers,
    maybe you can filter them but I want it to be a grid based page with certain
    blocks being external links to outside sources where you can find catsup.-->
    <!-- what should i do about people ripping catsup from here?
    I think the most basic thing I can do is just have these pictures be fairly
    low quality. Not good enough for print but I should be fine with the market-
    ting if anything from that. -->
    <!-- The sizes should be big enough  for a nice thumbnail I don't want these
    squares being too big anyway. at most 250x250 -->
    <!-- filtering and gallery logic
    should the thumbnails contain text at all?  maybe not but include text maybe
    when you click  on them.  Maybe clickable tags.  I can't  really imagine the
    stickers  themselves having much  descriptions  but i can  think so for  the
    external links-->
